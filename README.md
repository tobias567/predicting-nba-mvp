# Predicting the next MVP in the NBA
## In this three-part project, I set out to predict the next Most Valuable Player (MVP) in the NBA using data science and machine learning techniques

The project conists of the following three parts:

1. Web scraping
2. Data cleaning and analysis
3. Machine learning (working on this part now)

The data used for this project will be scraped from this webiste: https://www.basketball-reference.com.

Some of part of this project, especially the web-scraping part, is inspired by this video series from Dataquest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGQGd-oa0l4.
